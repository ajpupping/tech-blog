# Tech Blog
The Tech Blog will help users share what they've learned with each other.

## Description 

The aim of this project was to create a blog site, following the MVC paradigm. This application uses Handlebars.js, Sequelize, ORM, and express-session. Users can create an account, create new posts, update and delete existing posts. 

One of the goals of this project was to allow users to comment on posts. This feature will be implemented at a later time. 

This project was a great learning experience. Creating both the back-end and front-end, and then connecting them together was a huge challenge. I learned a lot about troubleshooting, resolving errors when routes didn't match up, keeping track of capitals and plurals within the variables, and importing/exporting modules. 

I also learned how to use add-ons with Heroku, such as JawsDB, which allows mysql and Sequelize to function correctly once deployed.
